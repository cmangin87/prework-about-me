    <h1>Dream Theater Fan Site!</h1>

    <p>
      Dream Theater is a progressive metal band formed in 1985 by guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and drummer Mike Portnoy.  Since then, they have gone through many different lineups andchanges in sound but remain my favorite band since I was 15 years old!
